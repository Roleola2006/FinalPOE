# FinalPOE
A couple of chnages have been made to the app firstly a feature has been added to the "Homepage" where the user will be able to see the average prices of the "Starters, Main courses and the desserts and the user will be able to see the description of each item once they clik on it. Secondly the feature where the user can add items has been moved to a new page called "MenuPage". On this menupage the user will be able to add the item once they added the information of the item the name, description, price and course.
